Directions:
Once you have started main.go, the shell will begin.
It will start by sending a starting message to let you know when you may begin typing the commands you wish to run.
Using the 'help' command will give you a list of commands you can run with this shell.
Once you are ready, You may type a runnable command and run it by clicking enter, then the command will run. 
Most of the commands do use parameters, but they are reflected in their linux documentation as to what parameters there are.
If a command does not exist or the parameters are invalid/null, the shell will let you know.

At any point if you wish to leave the shell, you may use the 'exit' command to quit.


Info you need to know: The code I made used the discord resource you provided as a base, So if you see any resemblances to it. That's why. https://hackernoon.com/today-i-learned-making-a-simple-interactive-shell-application-in-golang-aa83adcb266a
